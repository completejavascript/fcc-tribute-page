          <h2>Here are milestones of Brendan Eich's career:</h2>
            <h3>Early life</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Brendan Eich grew up in Palo Alto.</li>
                <li>He attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the class of 1979.</li>
                <li>Eich received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University.</li>
                <li>He received his master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Netscape and JavaScript</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>He started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April 1995.</li>
                <li>He completed the first version of a programming language in ten days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release schedule.</li>
                <li>The language was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in September 1995 and later JavaScript in the same month.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Mozilla</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>In early 1998, Eich co-founded the Mozilla project with Mitchell Baker, creating the website mozilla.org that was meant to manage open-source contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's chief architect.</li>
                <li>AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the Mozilla Foundation.</li>
                <li>In August 2005, Eich became CTO of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation, meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm.</li>
                <li>Eich continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript engine, until he passed on the ownership of it in 2011.</li>
                <li>On March 24, 2014, Eich was promoted to CEO of Mozilla Corporation.</li>
                <li>On April 3, 2014, Eich stepped down as CEO and resigned from working at Mozilla.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Brave Software</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, an Internet security company which has raised $2.5 million in early funding from angel investors.</li>
                <li>The company's co-founder is Brian Bondy, who worked on Firefox and Khan Academy. The company's employees include Marshall Rose, a network protocol engineer, and Yan Zhu, who worked on SecureDrop and Tor.</li>
                <li>On January 20, 2016, the company released developer versions of its open-source Brave web browser, which blocked ads and trackers and included a micropayments system to offer users a choice between viewing selected ads or paying websites not to display them. A recent update added inbuilt integration of 1Password and LastPass password managers.</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Basic Attention Token</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Eich is also the founder of Basic Attention Token (BAT), a "utility token based on the Ethereum technology that can also be used as a unit of account between advertisers, publishers, and users in a new, blockchain-based digital advertising and services platform".</li>
                <li>BAT launched its ICO on May 31, 2017 raising $35 million in just 30 seconds.</li>
              </ul>

            <h3 class="panel-title">List of qoutes:</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
            <ol>
              <li>Always bet on JavaScript.</li>
              <li>If the web can be evolved to include the missing APIs and have better performance, [developers] won't need to go
                beyond the web.</li>
              <li>JS had to "look like Java" only less so, be Javaâ€™s dumb kid brother or boy-hostage sidekick. Plus, I had to be done
                in ten days or something worse than JS would have happened.</li>
              <li>We're adding a lot of fun features.</li>
              <li>It's been over ten years, hard to believe. It was the Rodney Dangerfield of languages.</li>
              <li>It's time to get back to innovating in the browser space.</li>
              <li>Why the long freeze in JavaScript development? A lot of it had to do with the long freeze on browsers due to the
                IE [Internet Explorer] takeover.</li>
              <li>We're going to learn from Python. JavaScript is pretty close to Python.</li>
